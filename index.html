      <p>Ducks are intersting birds.</p>
    
      <p>They often walk around UW campus with little ducklings following closely behind them. In an effort to help them, the university created a duck ramp on the fountain.(you can see an image below)</p>
    
      <p>They are cute, but they also make the water in the fountain really dirty.</p>
